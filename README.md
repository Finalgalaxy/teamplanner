# teamplanner
TeamPlanner is a multiclient-server project with the goal of creating a virtual shared workbench where to draw anything you want.

This project is based on Java sockets, through the host-join mechanism (one creates the virtual room, others join in). Both server and clients will work on the same graphic panel: if someone draws a circle on it, everyone can see it in the same shape and position thanks to sockets communication. The idea is to build a workbench where everyone can work on it, share their ideas, contribute to reach points and discuss about them.

Work in progress. ;)
